<h2>A Proposal :: Santa Monica Coastal Resort :: June 10, BF 0</h2>

“It’s an opportunity, Tierslay. To get off this doomed rock. To make
something of yourself. That’s all. Stop squinting at me like I’ve got
some angle.”

“You always have an angle, Taernen. It’s who you are.”

“Sure. But in this particular case, the angle is looking out for little sis.”

Tierslay wanted to believe her brother. She ached for a shred of hope. Life in the Mojave tent slums on the outskirts of the Los Angeles enclaves was harsh — sun-scorched and stench-filled. The brutality of her youth in the favelas of São Paulo, plagued by gangs and typhoons, made the Mojave seem like a deluxe weekend getaway to an elitist orbital spa. Twenty-five years of existence and Tierslay had accomplished nothing beyond being poor and perpetually desperate. Taernen, on the other hand, had clawed and conned his way out of the dregs, made his way to California, and carved out a prosperous life. Somehow, from ten-thousand kilometers away, he had extracted Tierslay from São Paulo just before most of the city was under water. Taernen did not explain how he secured her passage to Los Angeles, crammed in a shipping container with a hundred other bedraggled climate refugees, and Tierslay never pushed him for answers. She was simply grateful to be alive. Almost everyone she knew in São Paulo was not so lucky.

Once in Los Angeles, Taernen provided her with just enough to survive for a couple of weeks. After that, she scrabbled for sustenance outside the enclave walls, among the millions of other refugees kept in line by the armed drones that cluttered the sky. If it wasn’t for her creativity with code and the illicit hack jobs that required her finesse, starvation would have consumed her.

Taernen lived beyond the concertina wire, among the privileged, among those who switched bodies and claimed to have defeated death. His fast talk and questionable connections furnished him with a lifestyle few with his upbringing would endorse, let alone afford — the augmentations, the cortical stack, the frequent backups. Their childhood had been steeped in Catholic zealotry and a strict adherence to bioconservatism, drilled into them by their mother’s incessant preaching, “Your body is a precious gift from God. Polluting it with trinkets conceived by man is an unforgivable sin.” For Tierslay, the doctrine stuck, tightly woven into the fabric of her worldview. Taernen dismissed it outright in his early teens, which got him tossed from the family hovel. A year later, their mother took a stray bullet on the way back from the market, another gang violence statistic. Tierslay was nine. She was holding her mother’s hand when it happened.

Taernen’s pitch continued. “Earth is a waste of time, Tierslay. All the corps with any clout, with any vision or ambition, they’ve fled. To Mars, to Luna, hell, even Venus. Those are the places where lives are made for people like us. And when I go, I’m not coming back. Where does that leave you? Begging on the streets with that low-life Monte because you’re mired in tradition?”

“Monte is not a low-life. He’s just had it rough, like us.”

“He’s the worst kind of criminal, Tier. Petty. Zero ambition beyond junkie survival. You’ve got too much talent. On Mars, with all the capital flowing, these corps need killer code. I could pull strings, find you an avenue in. You could go legit.”

“What? Legit like you?” Tierslay smiled and raised a glass in salute to her brother the criminal. He refused to clink.

“Didn’t you have your fill of the gutter when we were kids?”

“I have my way of viewing the universe and you have yours. I choose to remain pure in the eyes of God … ”

“The big white beard in the sky is blind now, sis. Had his eyes gouged out long ago.” Taernen flashed his older brother smirk while Tierslay shook her head.

From somewhere up above, from the smog-choked night beyond the twinkle of the resort’s canopy of lights, a neo-raven fluttered down to the poolside table beside Taernen. Tierslay flinched in disgust and backed away from the table.

“Calm down, Tier. He’s with me.”

“I hate birds.”

“Yeah, well, they’re probably not too fond of you, either.”

The neo-raven’s intelligent gaze flicked over Tierslay, tinged with inhuman distaste. Between its eyes protruded a small spike and etched upon its chest and glowing through its feathers was a nanotat depicting nine interlocked scarlet circles. With every intake of breath, a different circle would illuminate. Taernen and the neo-raven leaned in and exchanged whispers. Tierslay felt their eyes upon her despite her own being locked on the marble tile beneath her feet.

“I have to go, Tierslay. Business to conduct.” Taernen stood. “Think about my offer. Backing up simply means freedom. To go where you want to go, be what you want to be. Freedom from death. It’s pointless clinging to fairy tales, Tier. And remember, I’m just looking out for you. Like always.”

Tierslay nodded but did not reply.

The neo-raven launched back into the night sky and Taernen strolled towards the glittering entrance to the casino. A lean and exquisitely dressed man with a nine circle nanotat emblazoned upon the side of his shaved head stepped through the casino entrance to greet Taernen with a robust and familiar embrace. A moment later, a resort security pod was at Tierslay’s table, politely asking her to exit the premises now that her poolside sponsor was gone.

<h2>A Desperate Plea :: Mojave Tent Slums :: June 11, BF 0</h2>

Tierslay met Monte at his latest camp, in a wide alley behind a long-abandoned pork-processing plant. Decades after the place was operational, the stench still lingered.

“These Go-nin bot brains are tight, Monte. Especially the EEL 3, which I’ve never even set eyes on until now, let alone cracked. I’m going to need at least a couple of hours.”

“We ain’t got a couple hours, Tier. This guy is hot for a cracked 3. Price is no object. Big chunk of scratch could set us both up for a couple months. I need you to come through.”

Monte’s desperation was carved into his gaunt cheeks, in the way his threadbare t-shirt hung upon his wire thin frame. They had been friends since her first days in Cali and partners in petty crime for years. Tierslay hated seeing him like this, strung out and wasting away, a shell of the hustler who could smirk his way out of any jam. Life on the streets had finally beaten him into submission. The streets always win, Tierslay thought.

“How did you score the 3, Monte? That’s high-end gear.”

“We ain’t got time to discuss those kinda details, Tier. I need you in there, slicing and dicing, doing what you do.”

“Was anyone hurt, Monte?”

“What? No. I mean, I don’t know exactly. I can’t say for sure. I scored it from a guy who got it from a guy. I didn’t ask no questions. There was an opportunity, so I took it.”

Tierslay turned to leave. She had one rule with any of their ventures: no one ever gets hurt. Monte scurried in front of her, blocking her path, each hand clutching the other and shaking, the beggar’s pose.

“I know we have an understanding, Tier. No one gets hurt. But you gotta believe me. I don’t know for sure, and I ain’t ever gonna know. I need you to save my ass on this one. Please.” Monte’s eyes were wet with anguish and his lips were cracked by the unrelenting sun. Tierslay knew the look. She had worn it plenty of times herself — last-thread desperation dangling just above oblivion. She had to help her friend, despite the likelihood of violating the only steadfast rule of her criminal life.

“You’ve come through for me plenty of times in the past, Monte. Consider your ass saved.”

Monte wrapped his arms around Tierslay with a joyful hoot. “Fifty-fifty split and a big fancy meal on me. I’ll get us passes into the Heights enclave. We’ll eat a meal that’s actually grown and cooked, served on a dainty plate, spiral sauce drizzle! None of that wet-fab slurry!”

Monte set Tierslay up around the corner in a makeshift hovel constructed from shredded blue tarp and cracked wooden construction palettes. The spot caught a pocket of afternoon shade, providing respite from the hostile sun to a brain in search of focus. Tierslay had twenty minutes to crack the EEL 3 before the buyer was scheduled to arrive.

She rolled through the code. As suspected, it was tight. The proprietary locks on Go-nin cyberbrains were notoriously difficult to circumvent. The market for hacked bot brains stripped of cookie-cutter factory code was booming, though, on both sides of the walls, so Tierslay had spent a lot of her free time reverse-engineering the copyrightrestriction and access-control apps on any bot hardware she could get her hands on. Fuzzing the output or running a sophisticated debugging scheme were out of the question. Not enough time. Her only hope was to spot and exploit one of a handful of elusive vulnerabilities she had discovered in older Go-nin models. At the fifteen minute mark, she found one — a driver she could trick into coughing up the necessary crypto keys. Sweat dropped into her eyes as she ran her exploit and the security software parted before her. Root access granted. The bot brain was now a servant to her whim. Talent always finds a way, Go-nin. And with plenty of time to spare.

But then, gunshots.

Three of them. Pop. Pop. Pop. Perfect and precise syncopation. Professional.

The sounds knocked her out of the code. She stepped from the tent and crept through a sliver of shade. Peeking around the corner into the alley, Tierslay saw three sharply dressed synthmorphs, pistols at their sides. Monte’s lifeless body sprawled upon the gravel, blood blooming around his head. Tierslay crossed herself, begged for God’s protection, and ran.

She didn’t stop until she reached her tent block over three kilometers away. Blisters were forming upon her feet and her breath came in shudders of sharp stabbing pain. She doubled over and leaned against a dead palm tree. When she straightened up, she expected to see her tent in the spot it had been for the past two years, but it was gone. Nothing left but concrete and scattered piles of trash.

Tierslay considered just running. It would’ve been the smart thing to do. Instead, she rushed to the spot where her tent once stood. She kicked a cluster of crumpled fast food bags to see if there was anything left behind. Beneath them she spotted the wooden rosary her mother had given her for her first Communion. She picked up the trinket and cried. She clutched the rosary to her lips. “I cannot die here. Please don’t let me die here.” She kissed the rosary beads. In a whisper so desperate that Tierslay imagined her words carving their way into the soft wood, she asked Virgin Mary to steer her towards salvation.

<h2>Just In Case :: SkidRow :: June 13, BF 0</h2>

Tierslay arrived at the address Taernen had given her just before sundown, a windowless concrete box in one of the ghettoized neutral zones between enclaves. Squatted warehouses and tent villages spread out for kilometers in every direction upon baking asphalt. Tierslay was all too familiar with this crippling miasma of cyclic poverty; its spectre was always looming. Though she was loath to admit it, for years it had been eroding her faith. How could such misery and death be a divine plan? A young female face peeked at her through a billowing tent flap, like her own past staring through her, another sign to heed her brother’s call to escape.

A painted sign above the only door into the building depicted a manic pointy-hat wizard shocking the words Pinball Museum into existence. Tierslay knocked. A long wait followed, enough to question why she agreed to Taernen’s offer, an offer that would fundamentally change how she viewed the universe and her place within it. Then the door opened to reveal a lanky figure in a deep purple and skin-tight bodysuit. The synthmorph’s entire head was an elaborately detailed bloodshot eyeball, a yellow iris at its center.

“Greetings. You must be 6 p.m.” The figure’s voice was deep and tinged with reverb.

Tierslay suppressed the urge to run and answered, “Yes. You must be Ukku. My brother Taernen spoke very highly of you. Said you did great work.” Ukku stood still and silent. Tierslay had no idea if whatever was inside the bizarre head was taking a moment to evaluate her or was fast asleep in the open doorway. Her skin crawled over the awkward pause.

The giant eyeball head finally moved, tilting slightly. “I am the best, 6 p.m. You should be infinitely grateful that your brother cares so deeply for you. My services, while they may be considered cut-rate by those with the means to afford more upstanding facilities, are nevertheless, top-notch.” Ukku stepped aside with a flourish, beckoning Tierslay to enter. “Let us get to work, 6 p.m. Our time together is short.”

Ukku led Tierslay through a labyrinth of colorful fourlegged twentieth-century machines with whirling lights, analog clacks and dings, and promises of free plays. Despite her nerves surrounding the impending procedure, these simple contraptions from another time made her smile. She had seen pinball machines in old films before, but never in person, and the presence of so many gathered in one space, literally hundreds, was like unearthing an undiscovered tomb laden with riches.

At the farthest and darkest corner of the building, the pinball labyrinth opened into a small space draped with plastic. She eyed a metal table cluttered with surgical implements. Ukku introduced another eyeball, this one violet irised and with a body the size of a child, as his assistant, ToXxot. ToXxot rolled in a surgical bed covered in plastic, tossed a pillow on top of it, then took Tierslay by the hand and motioned for her to lie down on her belly and rest her face in the pillow. A strange machine was rolled next to her, a bulbous scanning mechanism unfolding like petals around her head. When everything was in place, ToXxot’s eyeball lit up and spilled intense white light in every direction. Ukku loomed over Tierslay, a menacing injection device in hand.

“This is happening so fast,” Tierslay said. “I don’t know what you are doing. I don’t know who I will become.” ToXxot stroked Tierslay’s back and made sounds that resembled the chirps of a hungry baby bird while Ukku spoke. “There, there, 6 p.m. Do not be frightened. You are with Ukku. By the time 7 p.m. shows up, you will be eternal.”

These moments would stick with Tierslay forever. The eyeballs. The terror. The biting dread of a life-altering decision as cold metal pressed against the back of her neck. The sensation of metallic centipedes uncoiling and slithering around her head and latching into place.

<h2>Lack :: The Zentropic Return :: March 13, AF 9</h2>

The view in Tierslay’s field of vision shifted. The floor was no longer concrete but wooden slats, arranged in an oddly soothing geometric pattern. She spasmed at the sudden sensation of falling. She thrashed for a moment, then calmed at the realization that straps held her in place. Weightlessness.

She was no longer in Ukku’s chop shop, that much was clear. She tuned into the sounds of the new space. A soft rhythm, a pleasing harmonic melody. The intention was obvious, to craft an atmosphere of calm. From somewhere deep inside Tierslay’s fog-draped mind, an unfamiliar voice made an introduction, the cadence crisp and formal. [Hello, Tierslay. Welcome to your new sleeve. Do you require immediate assistance?]

Panic hijacked her. The procedure. Something went horribly wrong. I’ve been rendered insane. Oh God. Or worse. I’m a corpse. Burdened by so many sins. When was my last confession?

The voice responded. [Unfortunately, Tierslay, that information is not available. Your calendar is entirely empty before today. Would you like me to create a previous event labeled “Last Confession?”] Whatever the source of the voice was, it was hacking her thoughts. Her body felt strange, somewhat stiff. The sensations of temperature, of fabric against skin, felt miswired. She could not feel the stretch of skin or muscles. She had command of her limbs, but the restraints held her tightly in place.

Tierslay tried to turn her attention to her breath, to the rise and fall of her chest, to the sensation of air soft and cool through her nostrils, but there was nothing to grasp onto. The processes no longer seemed to exist. Scream for help, she thought, but she could not feel lips or teeth or vocal chords. The entire biology of her head and face was absent. Not numb, but nonexistent.

The unfamiliar voice returned, pleasant. [A scream is unnecessary, Tierslay. I have alerted the technician that your upload is complete and full consciousness has been restored. He will be here momentarily to assist you. Then we can start to familiarize ourselves with this particular case model.]

Fuck off, devil. Mouth or no mouth, I am screaming myself hoarse. The word “Help!” bellowed from somewhere on the lower part of Tierslay’s face, created by a voice, both feminine and husky, but artificial and definitely not her own. Her panic magnified a thousandfold and she released the word a second time, drawn out and with an increase in volume.

A man floated into Tierslay’s limited field of vision. His skin was milk smooth, his eyes perfect circles of lavender. He smiled kindly. “Welcome to the Zentropic Return. My name is Badal,” the man said. Tierslay took a moment to assess Badal before responding, to determine if this latest freak was friend or foe, demon or angel.

The voice chimed in. [There is no need to be afraid, Tierslay. You are safe here. Badal’s facility boasts @-rep in the 95th percentile upon the flotilla. According to reviews, it is the top choice for those seeking a serene resleeve experience. You should introduce yourself.] Despite her reservations, for the first time, Tierslay decided to listen to the voice. “My name is Tierslay.”

“I know. Let’s remove these restraints. Get you moving.” The straps loosened and retracted. Tierslay found herself floating freely, unsure which way was up. Her arms flailed as she started to spin.

Badal helped Tierslay orient herself. “Apologies for the restraints. Strictly in place to guarantee client safety. A bit contrary to the zen aesthetic we strive for, I know. I sincerely hope they haven’t sullied the experience.”

Tierslay took a moment to adapt to the sensation of microgravity.

“I’m afraid.”

“Naturally. It’s quite a bit to absorb, given what I know of your ego’s history. Don’t worry too much about the weightlessness, you’ll adapt quickly.”

The room was cozy, ornate bamboo dimly lit by a soft glow that emanated from behind the parchment walls. Tierslay looked down at her arms. Where there once was dark brown skin, there was now metal, a dull slate-blue finish, dented and scratched. Tierslay expected tears to flow from the shock of the sight. She expected a wrenching of the gut, the tightness in the chest that can only be released by weeping gasps, but the biological systems required were no longer present. A realization crashed through every other thought like a nightmare tsunami — the only thing that remained of the God-given flesh-and-bone Tierslay was her mind, and even that was questionable.

“Where am I?”

The question was for Badal, but the inner voice provided Tierslay with an answer. [We are upon the scum-aligned flotilla known as Get Your Ass to Mars.] An augmented reality 3D map popped up to the side of her field of vision, showing a number of differently sized objects clustered together, most elongated, some linked together. Ships. Badal registered her confusion. “Get Your Ass to Mars is a nomadic anarchist collective of interconnected spacecraft and habitats, currently adrift just beyond the Main Belt, Jupiter side.”

“Jupiter.”

“Yes.”

Tierslay took a moment to process. What did the word “Jupiter” really mean to someone who had never even been on an airplane, who had never known anything beyond the concrete urban sprawls of a planet called Earth. Space. I am in the vastness of the black. Outside of the only body I have ever known. Tierslay shuffled all these concepts into another compartment, to be processed at another time. Latch on to something right now, she told herself. Like deciphering complex code, one line at a time before tackling the whole program. The voice. Deal with the voice.

“There is something in my head, a voice … ”

“Your muse.”

“My muse?”

“A limited AI assistant. Sorry. I wasn’t aware that you were unfamiliar with muses. An ego without one is extremely rare. It’s a default install during a resleeve if a muse is not already embedded with the ego.”

Tierslay had heard of muses. They were common among the privileged. She had never had one. To her family, AIs were an abomination in the eyes of God, and the implants they resided on an affront to nature.

“It’s getting on my nerves. Can I shut it down?”

“You can silence it, yes. Your muse is entirely customizable. But I would recommend opening yourself to the experience. Give it a name. Modulate its voice to a tone and cadence you prefer. In time, it will grow on you. I promise. You may even consider it a friend, eventually. I cannot imagine my life without Rikita. Rikita wishes you prosperity and joy on this new path, by the way.”

“Tell Rikita thanks.”

“I have other clients to attend to, but I have prepared a set of short introductory vids to acclimate you. Peruse at your leisure. I also recommend the zero-g simulator.” Several links popped up in her entoptic display. “Please, take your time. When you feel steady, the exit is to the left and at the end of the hall.” With a farewell nod, Badal kicked away toward one of the parchment walls and it slid aside.

“Wait!”

“Yes?”

“I don’t even know how I wound up here.”

“I believe your benefactor has the answers you seek.”

“My benefactor?”

“The man who negotiated your upload and morph. Abysmal rep but quite persuasive. Still not sure why I agreed to the deal,” Badal shrugged. “He is waiting for you outside the facility.” A virtual trail appeared, marking the way.

When Tierslay pulled her way through the bamboo-trimmed portal that led out from the cloistered serenity of the Zentropic Return, the transition overwhelmed her. In every direction, crowds of people sleeved in exotic body types floated and mingled. Laughter, shouts, and music engulfed her, spiced with the scents of food and stranger things. Structures, arrangements of gear, and things she couldn’t identify clung to every surface. She couldn’t tell if this was a party, art exhibit, or something else. There was no up, no down, just the bustle of life in all directions. Colorful invitations and propositions popped up in her vision before her muse filtered them away.

[Welcome to the Echo Blue sector,] said the voice. [This was once part of a luxury habitat in Earth orbit, spun for gravity, but the flotilla now tows it in zero g. Various scum factions use it as an open-air market slash social spot.]

Tierslay grasped on to the glowing trail like a lifeline, following it through the chaos to her benefactor, a skeleton-thin man with scattered wisps of long black hair. Her name hovered above the man’s head in AR, boldly flashing. Tierslay weaved through the stream of people and approached the man, suspicious, but also unsure of what else to do. The lower part of his face was rippled and shiny with designer scarification, and his eyes were vacant black disks. In her head, she imagined him donning a cape, like some Retro Space Dracula. His grin was no less fanged. “Hey, little sis. Long time no see.”

<h2>Reunion :: Echo Blue Sector :: March 13, AF 9</h2>

“I have questions … ”

“And I might have answers,” Taernen shrugged. “I might not.”

“How do I get home?”

“You are home. May as well make the most of it, yeah?” Taernen
popped the tube on his Americano sphere, the skin infused with
maple sweet cream, and sucked it down. He scowled at the graffiticovered
autocook mounted on the wall. “Cheap anarchist shit!” He
turned his attention back to his sister. “This is swill compared to
the coffee on Mars. Real stuff, grown in a hydroponic farm. Not this
wet-printer knockoff crap.”

“This is not my home, Taernen. This is not my body. I’m not even
convinced I’m still me. One second, I’m scared shitless, dealing with
your eyeball freak. The next, I’m here, half a billion kilometers from
Earth … ”

“I’m going to stop you right there, Tier. Jeez. I guess I forgot how
green you are as to the current state of the system.” Taernen cracked
his knuckles, then his neck. Tierslay waited, still and silent. “Hate
to tell you this, sis, but there is no going home. Earth is no longer
habitable. It’s a floating ball of nuke winter dust. Been a wasteland
for almost a decade.”

Cold enveloped her. “What?”

“Yep. Surprise. Welcome to life after The Fall. We messed around with
the TITANs, scary AIs, and they fucked our shit up good. Absorb it for
a second and let it go. Zero point dwelling on it. I prefer to keep the
fucked-up past dead and buried. Happier and more productive that way.”
Tierslay looked down at her hands, a familiar place to lock her
eyes when unsettled by a conversation with her big brother. The
sight of metal fingers unnerved her more. “What happened to the
real me, then?”

Taernen smirked, unable to resist an opening to dig deep and
twist, old sibling shenanigans. “Most likely, your flesh was barbecued,
seared right off the bones. And the bones? Probably in a pile with
billions of others. But who cares? The stuff that makes you you, the
stuff that ultimately matters … ” Taernen tapped his bony finger on
the side of his head, “ … that you made it out. Thanks to me.”

“Oh, God … ”

“Chin up, sis. Life is gonna get a whole helluva lot sweeter.” He
leaned in close and shifted his voice into the signature deadserious
whisper Tierslay remembered well. The timbre of the voice
was different, crackly and thin instead of deep and resonant, but
the inflections were unmistakable. “I’ve got a deal that cannot miss.
Once we close it, we’ll get you out of that metal can and into a
custom bio job.”

“I don’t want in on any more of your deals, Taernen. I don’t even
know who I am, how life even operates anymore, and here you are
talking deals … ”

“Tier, Tier, look at me.” Tierslay shifted her sight to Taernen’s unfamiliar
vacant black eyes, unsure if his gaze was meeting whatever
shape her eyes took in this foreign metallic form. For all she knew,
her face was nothing more than a flat sheet of steel with two dots and
a line. “You’re freaking out. I get it. This is a lot to take in.”
“I just want to be me again.”

“You think I’m happy with this loaner piece of shit I’m in? I’m
shocked none of the limbs have fallen off. Look. We can craft something
close to the original you, if that’s what you are into, once I have
some resources and we’re back on Mars where I have some pull. Here?
With these scum fuckers? I may as well be a crusty dog turd kicked
around the old São Paulo gutter. But, the good news is, I have a plan.

We can get around all this rep bullshit and keep this deal in play.
And this is where you come in.” Taernen clasped his bony hands
together, the sinewy fingers tense. “I need you to get it together and
adapt. Quick-like. I can’t stick around much longer. I’ve got a cast
scheduled back to Mars in an hour.”

“You’re leaving me here?”

“Yeah. That’s part of the deal. You, here, getting to know the place,
forming some relationships, contributing to their f ’d-up collective
shit, whatever it takes to get in solid. We need this, Tier. I’ll be back in
a month, maybe two. That should give you the time you need to lay
on the charm, get us the rep we need to pull a few favors. Then the
deal gets done, and we get you outta this freak show and back to the
inner system, where the people appreciate the power of an honest
cred for fuck’s sake.” The forehead on Taernen’s morph crinkled in
anger and the corner of his left eye twitched, a familiar expression
upon an unfamiliar face. Oddly, she found it comforting.

“So, I suppose you’re not going to give me any details on this deal.”

Taernen grinned. His sister, playing along as she always did. “Nope.
Better that way. The more knowledge you have, the more likely we
slip up. Have I ever steered you wrong?”

For a moment, Tierslay wanted to say yes, that she would have
preferred death to being trapped against her will in a metal husk.
The real her was dead. And she was, what? Some soulless copy? She
felt godless, abandoned, but not any less alive. Instead, she nodded.
“No. You haven’t, Taer. I trust you. I’ll do whatever needs to be done.”
The wide black globes set into deeply carved sockets provided her
nothing in return. A few awkward seconds of silence passed. Taernen
stirred. “All right then. I gotta go. I set you up with a dorm in the
Tall Red sector, opposite side of this chunk of habitat. Single room,
but you don’t need much. Synthmorphs are good that way, at least.
Minimalism. There’s a lotta people like you there, synths and the like,
so you won’t feel so weird, you’ll fit right in. All your basic needs will
be covered until I return. One last thing … ”

“Yes?”

“Don’t tip your hand to anybody. Concoct whatever backstory you
want, just steer clear of the truth. There may be eyes on the lookout.
Best if no one knows we’re blood. I’ll find you when I return.” Taernen
unclipped from the wall and pushed away, grabbing the strap of a
nearby tow-line cable. It pulled him away until he was swallowed by
the district’s throng. Gone.

<h2>Aimless :: Get Your Ass To Mars Swarm :: March 13-20, AF 9</h2>

For her first week, Tierslay wandered. Wandering was a skill she had
mastered over the years. With rarely a place to call home, her survival
had relied on it. She was reluctant to locate her room in the Tall Red,
fearful that a reality she was not quite ready to confront would settle
in once she did. Aimless felt safe. It felt like home.

During the first three days, she managed to move through
the linked spacecraft of the flotilla twice. Sleep was no longer
necessary. No need for sustenance either. She just kept her limbs
moving and her eyes cataloguing. She spoke very little, sticking
to the shadows when possible, absorbing details. She kept her
muse silent, allowing the AI to perform one function — drop pins
upon the flotilla map whenever she felt suspicious eyes were upon
her. By the conclusion of her second trip around, there were pins
everywhere, so she disabled the function and accepted that she was
being overly paranoid.

On the fourth day of her wander, while passing through The
Midnight Mastermind, a small freighter popular with uplifts, Tierslay
spotted a familiar but battered-looking model of Go-nin robot. A
neo-octopus fiddled with its cyberbrain while tapping at a nanofab
kiosk and muttering obscenities.

She decided to break her silence. “Those Go-nins can be difficult.”
The octo looked up from the bot, arms wriggling with frustration.
“You’ve seen one of these before?”

“One. Tight code but I was able to slice it. It was a long time ago,
though.” Just last week, she thought.

“I know a collector on Ceres, always eager to buy working vintage
pre-Fall models, but I can’t get this thing operational. Think you
could take a look at it for me? I’m Pivo, by the way,” the neo-octo said,
twirling one of his arms around Tierslay’s hand. She surprised herself
by not jerking it away.

Tierslay worked on the bot for about an hour before she had it
humming like new. It was a relief to delve into the code, familiar territory
amidst a sea of uncertainty. Impressed, Pivo pinged her with a
bump to her reputation score. The octo whistled from its siphon as
he perused her low rep, her blank history.

She answered his questioning look, “I haven’t been here long.”
What a ridiculous understatement.

“Y’know,” Pivo said, “I have a pal in the LO — the Lucky Observer —
she’s looking for a creative coder and you clearly have skills.” Pivo
tossed the location to Tierslay’s muse. “Talk to Elis. She’s expecting you.”
Tierslay scanned the area surrounding the kiosk, looking for eyes
upon her. A few scattered uplifts flew, swung, or scuttled by, all
minding their own business. Quit being paranoid, Tier. Go with the
flow. “Sounds great.”

As Pivo rode the bot away, Tierslay realized it was the first time she
had ever spoken with an uplift. Her church, her mother, had considered
them a crime against God, a sin of the highest order. She shook her
head, ashamed at her own bigotry. One conversation was all it took.

<h2>Narcos :: Danger Noodle :: March 20, AF 9</h2>

En route to the LO, Tierslay passed through a craft known as the
Danger Noodle. Its primary feature was a rotating torus, providing
simulated gravity for a never-ending bacchanalian dance party. The
vibe was intoxicating, a vibrant display of individual expression.
Synth, bio, uplift, infomorph projections, every conceivable shape,
size and modification, writhing and free, lost in rhythm. She had
never seen anything like it, and for the first time since awakening here,
Tierslay experienced joy. She decided to lose herself there for a couple
hours, move her new body and acquaint herself with its possibilities.
A hulking synth with four powerful arms approached Tierslay, the
head was a sharp rendition of a widely grinning oni. “I’m Berk.” Berk
extended their lower left hand in greeting. Tierslay kept moving
while she shook it. “Tierslay.”

“First time at the Noodle?”

“Is it that obvious?”

Berk’s husky chuckle was somehow in perfect sync with the lush
music. “I run security. I know everyone who rolls through here.
Welcome to the party.” An AR glitter-splash explosion popped as
Tierslay’s muse alerted her to the receipt of a transmission from
Berk — an executable file with the name _fi_zz_ee_66_.

“Fizzee66?”

“Latest and greatest narco. Coded by a regular. See that cluster
there, dancing in The Drip?” Berk extended one of their upper
arms to indicate a group of synthmorphs near where the dancefloor
curved upward out of sight, behind a neon blue drizzle. Their bodies
contorted ecstatically, backbends seamlessly transitioning into
headspins, handstands slowly wheeling down into splits. “They’ve
been running fizzee66 for two days straight. You should give it a try.
I promise it won’t disappoint.”

“I don’t have any money.”

The oni face smirked. “Neither do I. This is a gift economy, Tierslay.
Money is for oligarchs and serfs.” Following a low bow, Berk twirled
and strode off to another conversation.

Tierslay’s muse let her know the executable was clean and what a
brief mesh search revealed about the file. The effects of the narcoalgorithm
were rumored to be quite pleasurable. This muse thing is
growing on me, she thought and her muse responded with a soft
flutter of joy at the edges of her vision. Fuck it, let’s run it.

A tingle trickled through Tierslay’s synthetic body, starting at
the head and zipping pleasurably through her entire system, then
bouncing back up from her metal feet. The sensation mimicked
goosebumps buzzing on skin then melted away into a satisfying
warmth, magnified a thousandfold. Each ecstatic trip through her
body began with every other thump of bass that defined the beat.
Complete connection to the rhythm. Tierslay slithered over to
The Drip, to the group Berk pointed out to her earlier, and joined
their revelry for the next two days, never ceasing motion, Fizzee66
working its magic the entire time.

<h2>Opportunity :: Bateaux :: March 22, AF 9</h2>

“Pivo claims you have transcendent coding skills.”

“Wow. I’m flattered.”

“Don’t be. The squid knows hardware, but software’s not his
game. He has an eye for talent, though.” Elis hung from a lit tube
by her thick gripping feet, her hair writhing in the zero g like
freshly-fed purple and black snakes. Tierslay stared up at her, fidgety.
“Don’t be so skittish, Tierslay. Pivo and I are tight. His word carries
weight around here.” Elis swung across the room, re-orienting herself
in line with Tierslay, a perfect two-point landing punctuated by a
cocky grin. Elis’s custom synthmorph shop, Bateaux, was elaborately
cluttered, the workspace of a true artist with zero time to spend on
organization. “Let’s get right to the point. I build and mod synths, but
I also have a lot of people coming to the swarm who are looking for
specific cyberbrain plug-ins. That’s where I need help. What experience
do you have with coding narcos?”

Suspicion crept in. She thought about her brother’s warning and
all the eyes she had felt upon her. This is all lining up too perfectly. I
should be wary, right? Life has never been this easy, so coordinated. But
opportunity was intoxicating and had never knocked on her door
before. She decided to shed the paranoia and roll with it.
“Funny you should ask … ” Tierslay had her muse offer up
Zyzzee66 — her hacked version of Fizzee66. “This is something I
whipped up in a couple hours. It’s a hack of Fizzee66, if you’ve ever … ”
Elis cut Tierslay off and smirked. “Oh, I’m quite familiar with
Fizzee66 — I designed it. Did Pivo give you a heads up? That smartass.”
“I had no idea. I got it at the Danger Noodle. Someone named Berk.”
“So, you found it lacking? This Zyzzee of yours is superior?”
“Don’t get me wrong. I loved Fizzee. It’s sublime. I just saw a few
opportunities to elevate it in ways I found appealing.”

“Yeah, yeah, superstar. Enough chatter. Let me take a feel,” Elis
winked at Tierslay. “This is a bio sleeve, but the brain’s hardware.
Helps me check the code on the cyberbrains I install.” Elis’s pupils
dilated into royal blue disks and tears welled up in her eyes, then
streamed down her cheeks. A few seconds within the embrace
of Zyzzee66 was plenty of time for Elis to understand the talent
on display. She killed the process and took a moment to gather
herself. “Impressive. Not perfect, of course — you have to watch
those pseudo-dopamine thresholds, an initial rush like that can
trigger vertigo — but not so bad for someone a decade behind on
coding developments.”

She took a hard look at Tierslay, then bumped her rep. “Welcome
to the Bateaux family, my glorious narco hacker.”

<h2>Reflection :: Tall Red Sector :: March 22, AF 9</h2>

On the ninth day, Tierslay arrived at her room in the Tall Red.
She floated at the glass pane a few feet beyond her front door
and stared out at the Tall Red’s central hub, at the four towering
pillars draped in billowing red velvet, the feature that gave the
district its name. Bodies bustled about, below, above, drifting or in a
hurry, some synthetic, some flesh, forms she had never before seen
or could have previously conceived. This place is alive, she thought.
There was no relentless burning sun, no scorching asphalt, no
scrounging to survive. Despair seemed magically absent. Somehow,
she had escaped from hell. The anarchists she had known on Earth
had been jaded, godless revolutionaries. Until coming here, she had
never understood the point of their fight. Now, it was starting to
make sense.

Indoctrination kicked in and Tierslay moved to cross herself in
gratitude, but she stopped at “in the name of ” when metal fingertips
clicked against metal forehead. She gazed at her reflection, just a
phantom upon the glass. The details of her foreign face were hazy
against the backdrop of activity on the other side. She could sense
her silent muse absorbing her desire, and the quality of her vision
shifted. Everything beyond the pane darkened and Tierslay’s reflection
polarized into focus. For the first time, she saw her new face.
Vacant eyes, not meant for expression. No nose to wrinkle, just flat
brushed metal. Her mouth was a thin oval mesh, unable to move;
no smirks or pouts or licks or puckers. It was now simply an emitter
of soundwaves. In a profound second, a lifetime of belief dissipated
into nothingness, her soul crushed into non-existence. She was now
Tierslay the artificial construct, formed by the ambitions of transhumans,
not by the hands of any god. The revelation made her laugh.
Life. What a fucked up, splendorous mess.

A dragonfly the size of a fat cat zipped past Tierslay and down the
narrow walkway only to return in reverse moments later. It hovered
behind her, shiny rainbow metallic wings buzzing.

“Hello, new neighbor!”, the dragonfly said. “I’m Bixbee. Two doors
that way.” Bixbee’s many legs pointed down the floatway. “If you need
anything, you let me know. Someone did the same for me, hooked my
sorry ass up when I was new. My turn to pay it back. Or forward. Or
whatever. Point is, we look out for each other here in the Tall Red. It’s
all about storing up that sweet sweet karma. Okay. Gotta go. Buh-bye.”
Zip. Off Bixbee went.

Tierslay crossed the threshold to her new home. She drifted into
the only piece of furniture in the single room, a lattice cocoon that
held her in place. The room’s software spoke, asking what she wished
to experience. “Rain,” she said, and the environment changed, the
room darkening as AR clouds drizzled imaginary water down to the
other end of the room. She sighed, reduced her vision to meditative,
and focused on the sound of falling water. Tierslay reached out to
her muse, activated its voice and asked it a question: What do you
wish to be called?

[That decision is yours, Tierslay. What is your wish?]
She did not hesitate. Monte. Your name will be Monte.
[I think it suits me. Thank you. It’s pleasant to possess a name.]
The warmth of gratitude fluttered through Tierslay’s system as she
started to tinker with Monte’s voice, to get it as close to her old friend
as memory would allow.

<h2>New Client :: Beteaux :: August 2, AF 9</h2>

Tierslay and Elis floated in the shop’s cluttered space, arms linked,
scanning the latest custom morph requests. Bixbee zipped back and
forth overhead, jacked up on Tierslay’s latest narco, due to debut at
the Danger Noodle in a couple of days. Bixbee always clamored for
early access and Tierslay always obliged.

Four months and zero word from Taernen. Was he dead? Did he
abandon her? It did not matter. She did not miss him, his schemes,
or his promises. Tierslay had friends, her rep was growing, and her
coding skills were getting sharper.

“Ha! Check out this fool.” Elis tossed an image of a prospective
client into Tierslay’s AR, where it rotated slowly — a large eyeball
atop synthetic shoulders, a web of faux red capillaries stretching
from the yellow iris center over the entirety of a white sphere. The
body, elongated, with slightly disproportionate limbs wrapped
in a shimmering synthetic purple. Tierslay’s mind raced at
the sight.

“Tags itself Ukku.” Elis flipped through the morph customization
request and chuckled through a half-cocked smirk. “Listen to this
idiota: Ukku apologizes for the dismal @-rep, but Ukku is well established
within Guanxi networks and could arrange for some quidpro-
quo, which may come in handy someday, even for an anarchist.”
Elis clapped her hands in joy at the audacity. “What a jackass!”
Fear surged through Tierslay as her last moments on Earth
bubbled up out of the deep suppressed darkness and consumed her
thoughts. Eyeballs. Pinball. Plastic.

The morph request went on to state that Ukku would be
farcasting to the swarm in one week for an extended and indulgent
outer-system holiday and that it was Ukku’s understanding that
Bateaux was the best synthmorph design shop there. “Ukku only deals
with the very best,” Elis read, snorting. “Whaddya think? Should we
accept this lofty honor?”

Tierslay did her best to feign disinterest even as disgust rattled
around inside her. “I don’t know, Elis. Seems like a pain in the ass.”
“Maybe a pain in the arse is what this shop needs. Give us a jolt.
Been dull around here lately.”

Tierslay unlinked her arm from Elis’s, trying not to take offense at
the unintended slight as she floated away. “Okay. I’ll tell you what. I
will say yes to this stupid Ukku gig, under one condition.”
Elis perked up and rubbed her hands together with vigor, itching
for some fun. “Ooooooo! A negotiation. All right, I’m not big on
conditions, but what’s it gonna be?”

“The condition is this: I plant a secret little gift inside the narcos
this Ukku has requested to be installed with their shell. Nothing
major, just something undetectable and mischievous.”
Elis was easily hooked by mischief. “Spicy! Could potentially
damage our rep if word gets out … ”

“It’s a risk, I know. And there’s another condition: we keep an eye on
Ukku for as long as they are on the swarm.”

Elis allowed silence to sit for a moment as she studied Tierslay’s
face. “Now I’m really intrigued. What is this, Tier? Some sort of
history? A personal vendetta? You know this guy?”

“You could say that.”

“Do share!”

“Going to keep that to myself for now, if you don’t mind.”

Elis returned a conspiratorial smirk and a nod as Bixbee whizzed
by her head, giggling with narco-induced pleasure. “All right, Tier. I’ll
play along. You have yourself a deal.”

<h2>Prank :: Danger Noodle :: August 11, AF 9</h2>

Ukku had been on the Danger Noodle dance floor for four hours straight,
pointy elbows flailing, legs perpetually on the verge of collapse, forcing
others to dodge. Clearly, Ukku was high beyond comprehension, rolling
on Tierslay’s latest narco along with most of the club. Tierslay, Elis, Pivo,
and Berk watched the synth from the bar, Bixbee from his usual perch
above the DJ booth, waiting for Tierslay to trigger her prank.
On Tierslay’s command, Monte tossed a night-terror flash through
the backdoor in Ukku’s narco. Earlier, when Monte shared with her
the darknet image he planned on using (the stretched flesh and
floating gore left behind by an infamous Lost Generation murder
spree), Tierslay nearly retched, but Ukku simply straightened up for
a second of contemplation, then got right back to “dancing.”
“Well, that was anticlimactic.” Elis patted Tierslay’s arm. “The idiota
is unflappable. Guess it’s back to drinking until the tourist ceases the
pollution of our precious dance floor.”

Just as Elis was about to order another round of drinks for the
group from the autopub, Ukku ceased all movement, as if deactivated
by an unseen hand. Tierslay poked Elis playfully in the ribs. “Ha!
See? I got the fucker. Something is going down.”

In a rush, Ukku abandoned the dance floor and scurried towards
a booth in the Drip section of the Danger Noodle, currently awash in sharp shadows and an atomic neon green. A slender humanoid form,
etched upon the darkness, awaited Ukku’s arrival to the booth.
“Seems like someone finds the clown tolerable,” Berk observed.
“Finally, a new development,” said Elis. “We’ve had an eye on Ukku
for days now, zero contact with anybody. Intrigued, Tier?”
“I don’t like it.”

Elis pinged Bixbee and he zipped on over, bubbling with joy, as
always. “Tierslay! This new algo of yours, it’s got the thoughts all
marshmallow fluffy and I just can’t stop licking. Gonna flood Tall
Red. Woooo! You are a legend — ”

Elis cut Bixbee off, her tone commanding and unfamiliar to
Tierslay. The tone of a superior, not a friend. “Dial it down, Bix. Time
to get to work.” Bixbee slipped Tierslay’s latest narco into sleep mode
and the flutter of his wings dipped to a sane speed. “What’s the situation,
Elis?”

“There’s a booth in the back corner of the Drip. The Eyeball is there,
chatting it up with someone. I’m gonna tap into your sensory feed
while you get me a visual on the stranger. Slow and stealthy.”
Bixbee nodded his tiny head and moved towards the Drip without
a word. Elis shared Bixbee’s visual feed in AR with the others just as a
new round of drinks arrived. “Enjoy the show.”

Bixbee drifted slowly over the dance floor. He took a wide curl past
the sound bubble suspension from where DJ Myrmidon pumped
her glorious beats into the club. Tierslay’s gut clenched as Bixbee
approached the Drip. She knew what was coming. She wished the
entire club would evaporate into a wisp of mist, taking the stranger
with it, and that she would awake any second bathed in a cold sweat.
The Drip moved deeper into blacklight blues as Bixbee approached
the back corner booth. The silhouette across from Ukku knew how to
find shadow, yet Tierslay still recognized the distinct mannerisms.
The particular motion of two hands, accompanied by a presumably
self-righteous speech, driving home a point with a slow and intense
emphasis. It had to be Taernen. The gestures were too exact.
Tierslay’s brother finished his diatribe and Ukku nodded his
bulbous head. For a second, Tierslay had the urge to flee. Her life had
just started to gain meaning, a construction of her own will. Filled
with joy. Hope. Taernen’s return had the weight of a dark omen. He
was bound to fuck everything up. Trouble was permanently stitched
into his ego. She let the fear settle and dull a bit. She needed to hear
Monte’s voice.

Tell me everything is going to be okay, Monte.
[Everything is going to be okay, Tierslay.] A wink overtook
Tierslay’s AR.

She guzzled the booze and slid the empty glass down the bar,
its path curving slightly with the spinning habitat’s coriolis force.
Tierslay spoke up. “I know him. I know who it is.”
“You do?” Elis grinned. “Do tell.”

“It’s my brother.”

“This has gotten really interesting, Tier. Your mysterious nemesis,
the Eyeball, whispering in a dark corner with your brother. A brother
you have never mentioned before this moment. What’s next, Tier?
You going to reveal you’re some hypercorp spy sent here to infiltrate
us filthy anarchists, plant a nuke, and reduce the swarm to space
dust? A secret puppet of the TITANs, maybe, here to finish wiping us
out? ” Elis followed suit with her drink — guzzle, slide, curve.

“I’m not a puppet … ”

“Well, that’s a relief,” Pivo said.
Just then, Bixbee hovered too close to Taernen’s booth. Taernen
turned to meet Bixbee’s prying gaze, staring right through the AR
feed with milky gray slits. His face tilted out of the shadows and
into the blue glow of the neon drops cascading down from above.
Seamlines in the skull. Access jack sockets in the back of the neck. A
low-end pod biomorph, snatched right out of the bargain bin.
“Hey asshole. Do you mind? You’re invading our space.” Taernen
stood up and took an aggressive step towards Bixbee. Ukku slipped out
of the booth and flanked the dragonfly. Bixbee froze. Taernen sniffed
blood in the water and pushed the issue. “I said back up, flutterfuck.”
“Time to move. I’ll take point.” Elis propelled herself towards the
Drip. Pivo squirmed effortlessly past dancers while Berk muscled
dancefloor bodies aside. By the time Tierslay could gather herself
and follow, her friends were already through the crowd.
When Tierslay reached the booth, Taernen had Bixbee pinned
to the tabletop by his wings and Ukku wiggled a vibroblade a few
centimeters over Bixbee’s exposed torso. Elis was an arm’s length
from Taernen, a vicious looking firearm pressed firmly against his
seamlined head. Why does she have a gun? Pivo and Berk hovered
menacingly nearby, arms tense, weapons drawn.
“Whoa, now. There ain’t no need to splatter this twitchy brain of
mine all over the walls.” Taernen gave a smile, unafraid, practiced in
these types of negotiations.
“If the Eyeball drops the blade and backs off, it won’t come to that.”
Elis smiled too, comfortable as well.
“Everyone calm down!” Tierslay exclaimed, agitated. Taernen
flashed his eyes at her, hiding his recognition. She met his gaze. “No
one should have to deal with this asshole but me.”

<h2>Negotiation :: Echo Blue Sector :: August 11, AF 9</h2>

“Real nice friends ya got, Tier. I’ve rolled with gangsters who are more
hospitable.” Taernen popped his jet-black coffee sphere and slurped
it down. His third.
“You threatened our friend.” Tierslay had yet to touch her sphere,
oolong with a skin of honey and cinnamon, drifting between her and
her brother.
“I ain’t fond of little fuckers poking their noses in my business. It’s
rude.” Taernen leaned forward, eyed her up and down. “You know
what their deal is, right? Who they are? Who they work for?”
“What are you talking about?”
“Screw it. Doesn’t matter at this point. Was going to come to this
eventually. Can’t run forever, Tier. Sometimes, you gotta take a stand.
And that time is now.” Taernen’s eyes darted around, scanning for
threats and eavesdroppers. He’s on edge. More than usual, Tierslay
thought. She opted to redirect.
“It’s been months, Taernen. I’d written you off. Where have you been?”
“Out and about. Doing what I do. Made a few acquisitions. Dodged
some unexpected trouble. But now I’m here. To start a new life. Just
like you. Isn’t that what this place is about?” Taernen gave a phony
smile. The blank eyes of his morph betrayed nothing.
“I suppose that’s one way to look at it. I didn’t really have a choice.”
“But you’re happy.”
“Yes. I’m happy.” Or I was. She thought of her new friends. What are
they hiding from me?
“Well, there ya go, then. And you have me to thank. Now I wanna
be happy too. Maybe it’s your turn to grant a few favors.”
Tierslay punctured her sphere and sipped for a bit while she gathered
her thoughts. Monte chimed in. [You can just walk away, Tierslay.
You don’t want this.]
I know. What Tierslay wanted was for her past to remain so deeply
buried that it resembled a work of fiction. But I owe him. It’s not easy
to explain; I just do. He is still my brother. You wouldn’t understand,
Monte. Tierslay slipped the muse into sleep mode. Taernen tapped a
bony finger upon a bony cheek, blank eyes burrowing.
Tierslay took a deep breath. Her heart was racing. “What do you
need from me, Taernen?”
“I knew you would come around.” Taernen smiled and shrugged.
“I ain’t asking much. Just flex a little rep for me at one of the docks. I
have cargo coming in.”

“When?”
“Three days.”
“What’s the cargo?”
“Pod morphs, like this one.” He tapped his chest. “A dozen.
Biological, but with hardware brains, like bots. Cheap trash, but even
out here with the scum, morphs have value. Shouldn’t raise any suspicion.
Maybe you can even slip me one of those narcos you’ve gained a
rep for, so I can pre-load ‘em, give ‘em a little value boost.”
“Is that it?” Tierslay knew that wasn’t the extent of the favor, but
she asked anyway. Her brother never led with the big ask. There was
always something else.
“Nope. I need you to take a look at something for me. A recent
acquisition. A device. Do what you do best. Let me know what I’ve
got so I know how to peddle it.”
“I’m assuming this device is en route with the cargo.”
“It is.”
“And I am also going to assume that it is contraband.”
“No laws here, sis, but you could say that. If it’s what I think it is,
should be several interested parties around the Solar System willing
to shell out a fortune to get their hands on it. Potential bidding war
even. Then it’s easy street. No more hustling. Imagine that.”
“And how did you acquire something so valuable, Taernen?”
“Not your concern, Tier. Your hands will be clean. All I need is an
assessment.”
“You know my rule.”
“Fuck your rule!” Taernen spat the words as if they were venom
but returned to his calculated calm by the next breath. He shrugged.
“People got hurt. Lives were lost. So what? The fuckers would have
done the same to me. They are still on my ass and will not let up until
I unload this thing and disappear into the high life. This is the ticket
out. I’m not asking you any more, sis, I’m telling you. You’re going to
do this for me. Got it?”
She forced herself to meet his stare. “OK, Taernen. But this is it.
The last time. After this, we are done. No more debts.”
Taernen said nothing, just leaned back and smiled.

<h2>Revelations :: No Turning Back Cargo Freighter :: August 13, AF 9</h2>

Ukku ran the circular bone saw around the pod’s skull, sighing in
undeniable pleasure. He leveraged the top of the head off, revealing
the cyberbrain nestled within. Pulling it out, he dismantled it,
revealing a secret compartment. From this, he extracted a strange
cubic device — no more than a dozen centimeters to each side. Ukku
handed the cube to Tierslay as if the slightest jostle would shatter it
into a billion pieces. As the cube touched her metallic skin, a bitter
cold radiated through her palm. She found the device hard to focus
on, its features and edges strangely fuzzy.
“Ukku’s blade watches closely. Every move. Don’t forget.”
Taernen gave a smirk. “Relax, Ukku. Tierslay will behave. Right, Tier?”
“Right, Taer.” Tierslay considered smashing the cube against the
wall for a second, just to see his expression. But she was intrigued.
Ukku slunk back to the pod morph with its vacant head. A dozen
others just like it floated within nutrient suspension vats, strapped
together in bundles scattered in the cargo hold around them, each braced
against the walls. Ukku returned to carving flesh, this time maneuvering
a scalpel in a tight spiral on the pod’s chest, where a nipple would
normally reside. Tierslay could hear him giggling quietly to himself.
“Get to it, Tier. The sooner we know what we are peddling here,
the sooner we say adios, and you can get back to your happy life,”
Taernen said.
Tierslay tried again to focus on the cube. It appeared to be
composed of a single wound thread, some glassy black substance,
twisted into its perfect shape. Even in the microgravity, it felt dense.
She had never held anything like it. Is this alien? Some TITAN thing?
She pinged it for a mesh connection. No response. “We tried the
standard stuff, Tier,” Taernen said. “It’s not responsive. Work your
magic. Find out what it can do.”
She ran several scans on it with her tools. No ports, no way to
access it. Nothing. She could not even tell if it was powered.
“No obvious way in. No evidence of code. Hate to break it to you,
Taer. First glance, you have nothing more than a worthless trinket here.”
Even as she spoke, an AR window appeared in her vision. Her
nanodetector had found something. Mites. Nanobots. More windows
popped up. Her firewall flashed alerts — something was accessing her
personal network. But there was still no radio signal. She looked at
the cube in her hand. Oh god … the nanobots. They’re establishing a
physical link …
Tierslay tried to let go of the cube, but could not. All physical
function ceased. Paralysis. Stasis. She panicked as she could sense
something probing her mind, exploring every circuit, every electronic
synapse. Monte gurgled incomprehensibly. Warnings spilled across
her vision, signs of executing rapidfire exploits. [Muse system integrity
compromised. Unauthorized code signatures detected.] Monte
was being rewritten and she was helpless to stop it.
Taernen continued to speak, oblivious. “It’s TITAN tech, Tier. It’s
gotta be. Advanced AI gear. I wouldn’t have these fuckers all over
my ass if it wasn’t. Hey, what the fuck is wrong with you? Tier? Quit
fucking around! Hey! I’m talking to you!”
Ukku stopped carving flesh and floated towards Tierslay, blade
circling. “Oh. Seems to Ukku it is time for slicey, little lamb.”
A meter before Ukku reached Tierslay, holes erupted in Ukku’s
eyeball head, followed by the sonic whipcrack of railgun fire. As the
pieces of Ukku’s shattered sphere tumbled away, Taernen launched
himself towards cover. Tierslay remained still, locked into place. In
her field of vision, Berk slipped into the area with military precision,
sliding between two of the pod vats, assault rifle ready. Pivo and Elis
followed close behind, weapons aimed at Tierslay’s head.
The presence that had been Monte expanded, becoming massive,
filling every available cranny of her digital mindspace. The entity
reached out, silently probing, hungry to establish connections with
every device in the area. Terror seized her as Tierslay realized she
had become a conduit for whatever had taken hold of her through
the cube.
“Put down the cube, Tier, and back away. We don’t want to waste
you, but we will if we have to. There’s too much at stake. Your brother
is terrible enough, what you’re holding is far worse.” Elis said.
Loud gurgling sources suddenly interrupted the tension. Elis
traced the noises to the pod vats, tried to make sense of what she was
seeing. The nutrient gel was quickly draining away, uncovering the
morphs within.
“I gotta hand it to you, sis!” Taernen shouted, glee evident in his
hoarse voice. “I knew you’d come through! You brought these Firewall
fucks right to me. Gobble ‘em up, ToXXot!”
From beneath a shimmer of pixels, Bixby appeared just above Elis,
his camouflage dropped. “The pods!” he shouted. “He’s activating
the pods!”
Elis, Berk, and Pivo swiveled their aim, but too late. A dozen
pod morphs erupted naked from their suspension vats, feral fiends
ravenous for flesh and bone. A swarm of chaos overtook the cargo
hold. Weapon fire sprayed in every direction. Bodies tumbled in
free fall amidst globules of blood and nutrient gel. Shouts competed
with growls and howls. Taernen gloated and laughed, his trap
successfully sprung.

Tierslay floated stiffly as the battle unfolded around her. She
paid it no heed, her attention focused on internal windows, on the
presence that was Monte. She knew the signs; it was scanning for
exploits, looking to hack everything in the vicinity. With despair, she
watched it zero in on the vulnerability almost every ego in the cargo
hold shared — the backdoor Tierslay had coded into every instance
of her narcoalgorithms.
Stray bullets clipped Tierslay’s limbs, sending her into a nauseating
spin. The cube dislodged from her hand, spinning away
along with several of her fingers. She felt no pain, only watched,
barely comprehending, as the cube’s obsidian thread unraveled
and stretched outward, impossibly twirling into twin extensions of
lattice-wrapped cords. These curved in opposite directions, meeting
in a matter of seconds to form a circle several meters in diameter.
The swirl of combat cleared space around the intertwined black
circle as it began to vibrate with tight violence and power. The whir
quickly escalated into an overwhelming thrum that pushed every
eardrum in the cargo hold to the point of collapse. Hands went to
ears, postures crunched, weapons drifted away.
A funnel formed in the center of the circle, a swirl of space
bending and shredding, emitting crackles of static electricity. With a
flash of green lightning, the center vortex expanded to an ominous
pitch-black sphere, bound by the edges of the lattice. The thrumming
cut off suddenly. The silence in the cargo hold was thick and charged.
Pivo was the first to recover. “Sweet Poseidon, it’s a gate! A fucking
pandora gate!”
A vast weight drifted through the wormhole into the wireless
digital stratum of the cargo hold, a burden of intelligence so dense
that every operation in the vicinity stuttered, crushed beneath its
consumption of bandwidth. The presence surged through Tierslay’s
compromised mesh systems. Her entire mind sizzled with feedback,
pleasure and pain beyond anything language could articulate.
Monte swelled. It reached out past her, through the narco backdoors,
invading every cybernetic brain in the room.
Tierslay’s terror sidestepped into inexplicable joy. Her creation
was about to be embraced by a god-like being, weaponized by an
entity of almost limitless power. She knew she should be fearing for
her brother, her friends … but amidst the chaos, she found clarity.
She wasn’t sure who she could trust. They had their own interests.
Her heart scrambled for sympathy it could not find. Instead, it
swelled with pride. This was a TITAN, she was sure of it. She had
cleared the path for it, opened the door. She mattered.
The stunned combatants of the hold regained their equilibrium for
a few seconds, just enough time to reach in vain for drifting weapons,
before the presence struck. Individual minds were squeezed into
submission, their morphs paralyzed.
Static.
Tierslay suddenly found herself in Monte’s Mojave shack, the
Go-nin bot spread out before her. She stepped outside into the
blazing sun. Monte stood with his back to her, eclipsed in the alley
shade. The mountains in the distance rumbled; dark leviathan
shapes moved in the haze past them. She moved toward Monte,
could feel his attention from meters away. She forced herself closer,
reached out, and —
A firehose of traffic slammed through her, as not-Monte tore
through every digital mind in the cargo hold. Lifetimes of compressed
memories passed through Tierslay at unfathomable speeds,
consumed by the insatiable presence. She immersed herself in the
flow, let the packets swirl past her, and —
Through Bixbee’s eyes, his initiation into a secret organization
called Firewall.
Through Berk’s eyes, a briefing about Taernen and the details of a
mission to recover a stolen TITAN artifact.
Through Elis’s eyes, the construction of a long-term plan to encapsulate
and befriend Tierslay, to use her to get to Taernen.
Through Taernen’s eyes, his payment of goons to kill Monte, his
deal with Ukku, and Tierslay’s final day on Earth.
In the desert heat, she fell to her knees in front of Monte and
sobbed. It was all lies and false pretenses and treachery. None of these
people cared about her. None were her friends. She lamented for what
felt for hours. Tears of betrayal stained the dust at Monte’s feet.
When she looked up, Monte was gazing down at her inscrutably. The
moment stretched, night fell. His face was swallowed by the darkness.
Static.
Tierslay found herself back in the cargo hold. Floating husks
surrounded her, gouged with wounds, their minds gone, egos taken.
Forcibly uploaded. She tried to locate her brother, but couldn’t pick
him out among the carnage and other pods.
The cyclopean presence — Monte — was gone. The signal emanating
through the gate blinked out. She knew he, it, was there. On the
other side.
The open gateway purred with its promise of escape. Tierslay
stared into the black sphere, trying to glean a hint as to what may
lie beyond. Faint swirls of spectral colors shifted one to the next at
the edges. Is this an invitation? Why was I spared? She contemplated
what it would mean to follow it through, to expand her talents
beyond anything transhumanity could ever conceive. This thing, it
chose me. I know it. Ambition burned through her.
A sound, movement. She spun to spot Pivo across the hold,
clinging to a vat door, missing arms and oozing blood. Of course, she
thought, he was the only one here with a bio brain.
“Don’t do it, Tier. Don’t go though.” His voice was tinged with pain.
“You little shit, Pivo. I trusted you. I trusted each and every one of
you. I considered you friends. Family, even. Who the fuck were you
people?”
“We’re still your friends, Tierslay. Yes, we lied about some things.
We didn’t know if we could trust you. That was wrong. But we’re on
the same side here. Your broth — ”
“My brother is gone. Just like the others.”
The lattice began to contract, slowly shrinking the wormhole
sphere. In seconds, it would collapse into nothingness. Stay or go?
No matter how she would spin it, the blame for what happened in
the cargo hold was going to fall upon her. Whoever this Firewall was,
they would certainly be coming for her. They were now her enemies.
The thought molded a grin upon her lips. It’s a no-brainer. Start again.
Trust no one. It’s what you are best at, isn’t it? But now, for once, I will
no longer be the oblivious prey.
She hesitated, still uncertain if she should enter the swirl into
the dark unknown. Taernen came to mind, one of the few moments
when they were children and he was vulnerable, when she risked her
life to save his, the first great flash flood to hit the Heliópolis favela.
Then she considered the memories she had experienced, how he too
had betrayed her. She chuckled. “What a fucking scumbag.”
Tierslay grabbed on to the edges of the lattice and swung herself
feet first through the wormhole, certain that one day she would
return to repay those who had wronged her.
The threads of the lattice unwound and reformed into the tiny
black cube. Pivo watched, barely retaining consciousness, as
the device floated among the empty husks for a moment before
reforming into a miniature dragonfly. The device buzzed over to the
open airlock, leading to the rest of the ship, and disappeared.
