<p>The universe of Eclipse Phase is ripe with experiences that will rattle your sanity. Some are as mundane and human as extreme violence, extended isolation, or helplessness. Others are less common, but even more terrifying: encountering alien species, infection by the exsurgent virus, or facing down an extinction threat.</p>

<h1>Willpower Stress Tests</h1>
<p>Whenever you encounter a situation that might impact your ego’s psyche, make a WIL Check. Some incidents are so horrific that a modifier is applied. If you fail, the experience scars your mental landscape and you suffer stress damage (and possibly trauma) as appropriate to the situation. If you succeed, you cope with the unnerving situation, but it may still rattle and shake you.</p>

<p>A list of stress-inducing scenarios and suggested SVs are listed on the Stressful Experiences table. The GM should use these as a guideline, modifying them as appropriate to the situation at hand.</p>


<h1>Hardening</h1>
<p>The more you are exposed to horrible or terrifying things, the less scary they become. After repeated exposure, you become hardened to such things, able to shake them off without effect.</p>

<p>Every time you suffer a trauma due to stress from alienation, helplessness, or violence (Stress Categories ▶222), take note. If you survive such a traumatic situation 5 times without acquiring a disorder, you become effectively immune to that type of stress in the future. You acquired the Hardening trait ▶74 for that type of stress. You can never become hardened to stress from the unknown. You also cannot become hardened to stress if you currently have a disorder triggered by that type of stress.</p>

<p>The drawback to hardening yourself is that you grow detached and callous. In order to protect yourself, you cut off your emotions — but it is such emotions that make you transhuman. You have erected mental walls that affect your empathy and ability to relate to others. Each Hardening trait means you suffer –10 to both WIL Checks and Persuade Tests.</p>

<p>Psychosurgery can be used to overcome hardening, in the same way a disorder is treated.</p>
