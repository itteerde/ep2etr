<p>Influence effects — in particular, the impulses and compulsions — provide character to your specific infection. They speak to a range of behaviors that put a face on the entity affecting you. Players and GMs are encouraged to use this to generate a personality of sorts for the infection itself. Perhaps they hint at specific alien physiologies, motivations, or cultural mannerisms. Though the exovirus should always remain inscrutable to some degree, its likely manifestations can provide indicators for its general outlook and intentions, which you can then use to add flavor to your PC’s own actions.</p>
<p>In this vein, the influence effects provided for each sub-strain should be considered customizable. Perhaps you envision an async that is so traumatized and confused by the haunter sub-strain that one of their influence effects is to fly into an uncontrollable rage, lashing out at whatever is around them, even their allies and loved ones. Or perhaps you ascribe a motivation of focused self-interest to the stranger and so devise an influence effect that compels your async to act in completely selfish and narcissistic ways, no matter the detriment to others. Maybe your idea for the xenomorph is that it stems from a hive-mind perspective, and so the async might fail to understand the concept of the individual or lash out at behavior divergent from perceived collective goals. Use the effects as listed for guidelines, while also considering options such as temporary disorders ▶224, enhanced behaviors ▶78, restricted behaviors ▶80, or even negative traits such as Neural Damage ▶79.</p>

	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td style="padding-left: 10px;">4</td>
		<td><strong>Motivation: +Hoard.</strong> You instinctively and secretly collect things for purposes that are not entirely clear to you. This might range from electronics components to rare elements to a variety of weapons — or it might apply to stranger things such as skin or internal organs. You not only accumulate these items, but stash them away in hidden caches to protect them from others.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td style="padding-left: 10px;">5</td>
		<td><strong>Motivation: +Expose Inner Workings.</strong> You become hyperfocused on the most interesting person, thing, or mystery in your immediate vicinity. This might be an unusual morph, a high-tech device, an unsolved puzzle, or something you have never experienced before. If nothing stands out, you fixate on the nearest person or thing that is newest to you. You are compelled to learn all about the subject by tinkering with it, testing it, taking it apart, and examining it piece by piece.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td style="padding-left: 10px;">6</td>
		<td><strong>Motivation: +Create.</strong> You are obsessed with an elusive idea for a new creation. This may be a sculpture, a robot, a neogenetic life form, or something weird. The nature of the design relies on your skills and available resources. It might also require components or resources that are unusual (blood, bones) or hard to find (uranium, antimatter). The idea itself may not be fully formed or realized in your head — you may not understand even after you finish it. If you are unlikely to complete the design before the compulsion ends, you will be inclined to secretly store it and pick up the project again the next time you are compelled.</td>

		<td><strong>Hallucination:</strong> Within the next 24 hours, you experience a full-sensory hallucination. The GM describes a scene to you as if were real, and you respond accordingly. The hallucination may be as subtle as seeing something crawling under an NPC’s skin to as immersive as suddenly finding yourself in an alien environment, but it lasts no more than a few minutes. If you have cause to disbelieve the illusion, you may make an INT Check to spot the falsehood; even if successful, however, the hallucination will still play out. Some hallucinations may just provide unnerving or horrifying experiences, a sign that the universe is unraveling around you. Others may provide obfuscated insights, reveal hidden connections, or hint at things to come.</td>
