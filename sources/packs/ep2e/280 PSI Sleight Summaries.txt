<h2>PSI-Chi Sleights</h2>
<p>Psi-chi sleights are passive, always-on, subconscious abilities available to anyone with the Psi trait. They are considered automatic actions and require no effort to maintain. Psi-chi sleights add bonuses to specific actions or enable new abilities rather than calling for a skill test. Most enhance the async’s perception, intellect, mental control, or ability to process information.</p>
<h3>Charisma</h3>
<p>Your inhibitions are lowered, social intuition expanded, and emotional intelligence augmented. This enhances your ability to navigate social situations and process emotional information. Increase Moxie pool by 1.</p>
<h3>Control Behavior</h3>
<p>You can fine-tune your emotional state. Apply an Enhanced Behavior or Restricted Behavior (Level 2) trait ▶80 of your choice at will. You may not change it again until you have taken a recharge action. At the GM's discretion, this trait may apply a +/–10 modifier in some situations. Alternatively, use this to reduce an Enhanced/Restricted Behavior trait imposed on you by up to two levels. You can push this sleight to raise the effect to Level 3 (or three levels of reduction).</p>
<h3>Eco-Empathy</h3>
<p>With a successful COG Check, you acquire an intuitive understanding of non-sentient, non-terrestrial organisms occupying a producer niche in the local ecosystem (e.g., alien plant and fungus analogues). The information you gain is of a general and qualitative nature, and doesn’t include data you would normally acquire from chemical or genetic analysis. For example, you could determine if a plant thrives only in riparian zones, if it relies on insect analogs for pollination, or if it produces tubers that are edible to transhumans when cooked.</p>
<h3>Enhanced Creativity</h3>
<p>You are more imaginative and inclined to think outside the
box. Apply a +10 modifier to Know or Technical skill tests where
creativity plays a major role. This level of ingenuity sometimes
seems strange and unusual, manifesting as odd insights or creepy
details, especially with artwork.</p>
<h3>Enhanced Memory</h3>
<p>You have a perfect memory. Unlike transhumans with hyperthymesia,
this is not strictly autobiographical. You can be asked a
random date and immediately recall trivial details such as the day
of the week it was, what you did that day, what the weather was like,
and the exact wording of a paragraph you read. Your memory is
always “on” — in fact, you perceive reality and memory much like a
split screen and are often caught in reverie. Enhanced memory has
no effect on psychosurgery memory editing.</p>
<p>You can push this sleight to recall your memories from a sort of
third-person point of view, allowing you to make Perceive Tests to
notice details you may have previously missed.</p>
<h3>Grok</h3>
<p>You intuitively understand how to use an unfamiliar object, vehicle,
or device, no matter how alien, advanced, or bizarre. You may make a
COG Check to determine how to activate or use it, simply by looking
at and handling it. This sleight does not provide any understanding
of the principles or technologies involved — you simply grasp how to
make it work. This sleight is only effective with unfamiliar devices, it
provides no bonus when using devices with which you are familiar.</p>
<h3>Heightened Awareness</h3>
<p>Your situational awareness is boosted, providing an instinctive
sense about an area and any potential threats nearby. +10 to
Perceive Tests.</p>
<h3>High Pain Threshold</h3>
<p>You can block out, ignore, or otherwise isolate pain. Ignore the
modifiers from a single wound (this is cumulative with other effects,
up to a maximum of three wound effects).</p>
<h3>Inner Spark</h3>
<p>You have an inner well of energy, making it easier to recuperate. You
recover +1 pool points during short recharges.</p>
<h3>Pattern Recognition</h3>
<p>You are adept at spotting patterns and correlating non-random
elements. This is useful for translating languages, breaking codes, or
finding clues hidden among massive amounts of data. Apply a +10
modifier to appropriate Infosec, Perceive, or Research Tests where
you have a sufficiently large sample and time enough to study, as
determined by the gamemaster. This might range from a few hours
of investigating inscriptions left by long-dead aliens to a week or
more of researching a lengthy cipher. This does not apply to bruteforce
hacking or Infosec tests made by decrypt apps to break a code.
You also learn new languages easily; reduce the timeframe to weeks
rather than months.</p>
<h3>Predictive Boost</h3>
<p>Your brain’s bayesian probability functions are accelerated,
enhancing your ability to estimate and predict the outcomes of
events as they unfold in real-time around you. In effect, you have an
intuitive sense for the most likely outcomes. +2 Initiative.</p>
<h3>Psi Armor</h3>
<p>Your mind’s defenses are solidified. You gain mental armor equal to
your WIL ÷ 3 against psi attacks.</p>
<h3>Qualia</h3>
<p>You have a more intuitive grasp on the world around you. +1 Insight pool.</p>
<h3>Savant Calculation</h3>
<p>You have an incredible faculty for intuitive mathematics involving
complex, chaotic systems. You can calculate your odds when
gambling, predict the outcome of stock market upheavals, and
guesstimate the rubble distribution pattern from an explosion. You
can also measure exact distances with a look, solve math problems
faster than computers, and tell how many microbots make up a
swarmanoid. This talent, however, is not conscious, it is intuitive.
You do not know the equations you are solving, you simply know
the solution. You may make COG Checks to calculate answers to
complex mathematical questions.</p>
<h3>Scramble</h3>
<p>Scramble helps you to hide from another async using the ego sense
sleight ▶284. Apply a –30 modifier to the async’s Psi Test.</p>
<h3>Self Control</h3>
<p>Your will is tempered and unyielding. +10 to WIL Checks.</p>
<h3>Social Cunning</h3>
<p>Your emotional intelligence is sharpened and focused, making you
more manipulative and exploitive of weaknesses. +10 to Persuade
and Provoke Tests.</p>
<h3>Somatic Control</h3>
<p>You have excellent physiological control. +1 Vigor Pool.</p>
<h3>Superior Kinesics</h3>
<p>You haver finer control over your emotive signals, body language,
and micro-expressions and are more capable at interpreting the
same in others. +10 to Deceive and Kinesics Tests.</p>
<h3>Xeno-Empathy</h3>
<p>You have an intuitive understanding of non-human, non-terrestrial
organisms (animal analogues). You can make a SAV Check
to acquire insight into the creature’s ecological niche, motivations,
needs, and likely behavioral responses (if non-sapient) or mental/
emotional state (if sapient).</p>
