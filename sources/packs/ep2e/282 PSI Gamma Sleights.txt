<p>Psi-gamma sleights influence the function of biological minds (egos
within a biomorph, but also including animal life). Psi-gamma is only
available to characters with Level 2 of the Psi trait. Psi-gamma sleights
must be activated, requiring a quick, complex, or task action and a Psi
skill test. Sleights that target other sentient beings or life forms are
always opposed tests, while others are handled as success tests. Active
sleights require significant effort from the async and may cause their
exovirus infection to flare up (Infection Modifiers ▶276).</p>
<h3>Alter Effect</h3>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Action:</strong> Complex</li>
	<li><strong>Duration:</strong> Instant</li>
	<li><strong>Infection-Mod:</strong> 2</li>
</ul>
<p>You trigger or ease a neurochemical response within the target,
either decreasing or increasing the duration of a drug, chemical, or
toxin by half.</p>

<h3>Animal Control</h3>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Action:</strong> Complex</li>
	<li><strong>Duration:</strong> Sustained</li>
	<li><strong>Infection-Mod:</strong> 6</li>
</ul>
<p>You take over the mind of a non-sapient animal. While sustained,
you control the animal exactly like remotely operating a drone ▶346.
You may switch between autonomous mode and jamming.</p>

<h3>Aphasia</h3>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Action:</strong> Complex</li>
	<li><strong>Duration:</strong> Minutes</li>
	<li><strong>Infection-Mod:</strong> 6</li>
</ul>
<p>You create a temporary stroke-like effect within the target’s
brain that disrupts their speech and language centers. For WIL ÷ 5
minutes, they are incapable of speaking, communicating, reading,
and understanding language.</p>

<h3>Basilisk Stare</h3>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Action:</strong> Task</li>
	<li><strong>Duration:</strong> Sustained</li>
	<li><strong>Infection-Mod:</strong> 6</li>
</ul>
<p>You make eye contact with the target and immobilize them. As
long as you keep your gaze locked on them (minor blinking aside),
they cannot move, avert their eyes, or undertake any action (including
mesh and mental actions). You must also limit your movement,
though you may move at half your base move and/or take quick
physical actions, but you must make a REF Check to keep your eyes
locked, and actions requiring a test and visual coordination suffer a
–30 modifier. Likewise, if the target is attacked, moved, or otherwise
jostled, eye contact is lost.</p>
<p>You may not affect extra targets with this sleight, unless you have
more than one set of eyes.</p>

<h3>Block Pain</h3>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Action:</strong> Complex</li>
	<li><strong>Duration:</strong> Minutes</li>
	<li><strong>Infection-Mod:</strong> 4</li>
</ul>
<p>You impede the target’s pain receptors. For WIL ÷ 5 minutes, the
target can ignore the effects of one wound, plus one per superior
success. This is cumulative with other pain editing effects, up to a
maximum of 3 wound effects.</p>

<h3>Block Sense</h3>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Action:</strong> Complex</li>
	<li><strong>Duration:</strong> Action Turns</li>
	<li><strong>Infection-Mod:</strong> 4</li>
</ul>
<p>You short-circuit and temporary disable one of the target’s sensory
cortices (your choice). For WIL ÷ 5 action turns, the target loses
that type of sensory input. The senses that may be negated include
sight, hearing, touch, smell, taste, hunger, balance, direction,
proprioception, facial recognition, and augmented senses such as
electrical sense and radiation sense. Any actions that rely on the
impaired sense require a test with a minimum –30 modifier.</p>

<h3>Block Skill</h3>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Action:</strong> Complex</li>
	<li><strong>Duration:</strong> Minutes</li>
	<li><strong>Infection-Mod:</strong> 6</li>
</ul>
<p>You install a temporary block in the target’s brain, preventing
them from using one specified skill (they may not even default) for
WIL ÷ 5 minutes.</p>

<h3>Browse Thoughts</h3>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Action:</strong> Complex</li>
	<li><strong>Duration:</strong> Sustained</li>
	<li><strong>Infection-Mod:</strong> 4</li>
</ul>
<p>You scan the target’s surface thoughts, gaining a general sense of
what is currently running through their mind. Superior successes
provide deeper detail. This is not an invasive delve into the target’s
mind for specific information like Deep Scan ▶next column; instead,
you simply get a read on what the target is currently thinking.</p>

<h3>Burst of Adrenaline</h3>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Action:</strong> Complex</li>
	<li><strong>Duration:</strong> Minutes</li>
	<li><strong>Infection-Mod:</strong> 6</li>
</ul>
<p>You revive the target with a rush of endorphins and energy. They
receive +1 Vigor pool for WIL ÷ 5 minutes. A target may only benefit
from one burst of adrenaline at a time.</p>

<h3>Burst of Clarity</h3>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Action:</strong> Complex</li>
	<li><strong>Duration:</strong> Minutes</li>
	<li><strong>Infection-Mod:</strong> 6</li>
</ul>
<p>You refresh the target’s mind, enabling them to see things in a
new light. They receive +1 Insight pool for WIL ÷ 5 minutes. A target
may only benefit from one burst of clarity at a time.</p>

<h3>Burst of Confidence</h3>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Action:</strong> Complex</li>
	<li><strong>Duration:</strong> Minutes</li>
	<li><strong>Infection-Mod:</strong> 6</li>
</ul>
<p>You instill the target with renewed determination and empowerment.
They receive +1 Moxie pool for WIL ÷ 5 minutes. A target may
only benefit from one burst of confidence at a time.</p>

<h3>Cloud Memory</h3>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Action:</strong> Complex</li>
	<li><strong>Duration:</strong> Minutes</li>
	<li><strong>Infection-Mod:</strong> 6</li>
</ul>
<p>You temporarily disrupt the target’s ability to form long-term
memories. The target will retain short-term memories during the
duration (WIL ÷ 5 minutes), but will soon (after d6 + 4 action turns)
forget anything that occurred while this sleight was in effect.</p>

<h3>Deep Scan</h3>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Action:</strong> Complex</li>
	<li><strong>Duration:</strong> Sustained</li>
	<li><strong>Infection-Mod:</strong> 6</li>
</ul>
<p>Deep Scan is a more intrusive version of Browse Thoughts ▶previous
column. You telepathically invade the target’s mind and probe it for
information. You extract two pieces of information (i.e., a name,
image, passcode, description or summary a few sentences long, or
a memory of less than a minute) plus two for each superior success.
Each item takes one full action turn to retrieve, during which the
sleight must be sustained.</p>

<h3>Deja Vu</h3>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Action:</strong> Complex</li>
	<li><strong>Duration:</strong> Minutes</li>
	<li><strong>Infection-Mod:</strong> 8</li>
</ul>
<p>Your force the target’s mind into recursive loop. They will repeat
their actions from the previous 15–30 seconds (5–10 action turns)
for the next WIL ÷ 5 minutes. They will repeat their actions as
closely as possible, even if their environment and circumstances
change. If someone actively interrupts or restrains the target, or
otherwise disrupts the loop, they may make a WIL Check to break
out of the loop, ending the sleight.</p>

<h3>Downtime</h3>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Action:</strong> Task</li>
	<li><strong>Duration:</strong> Sustained</li>
	<li><strong>Infection-Mod:</strong> 2</li>
</ul>
<p>You slip the target’s mind into a fugue-state regenerative downtime,
to repair their psyche. You must sustain this sleight for 4 hours during
which you may take no other complex actions. Downtime cannot be
concurrent with a long recharge. This process heals 1d6 stress, +1d6
per superior success. Traumas and disorders are unaffected by this
sleight. If interrupted, no stress is healed. For all sensory purposes,
you and the target are catatonic during downtime, completely oblivious
to the outside world. Only severe disturbances or physical shock
(such as being wounded or hit by a shock weapon) will bring you or
the target out of it. Any target of this sleight other than yourself must
make a WIL Check; if they fail, sometime within the next 24 hours
they will be subject to one of your influence effects ▶278.</p>

<h3>Ego Sense</h3>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Action:</strong> Complex</li>
	<li><strong>Duration:</strong> Action Turns</li>
	<li><strong>Infection-Mod:</strong> 2</li>
</ul>
<p>You detect the presence and location (rough direction from yourself )
of other sentient and biological life forms (i.e., egos and animals) within
Close range. Each life form makes an opposed test against your roll.
You suffer modifiers for size, the same as for ranged attacks. Superior
successes provide additional details: approximate size, exact distance,
type of creature, etc. If the target moves during the duration (WIL ÷ 5
action turns), you will have a rough idea of their speed and bearing.</p>

<h3>Empathic Scan</h3>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Action:</strong> Complex</li>
	<li><strong>Duration:</strong> Action Turns</li>
	<li><strong>Infection-Mod:</strong> 4</li>
</ul>
<p>You sense the target’s emotional state for WIL ÷ 5 action turns.
This provides you with a +10 modifier for social skill tests against
the target, +10 per superior success. This sleight will not automatically
detect deceit, but it will pick up on nervousness, doubt, anxiety,
etc. and provide a bonus to Kinesics Tests against Deceive.</p>

<h3>Illusion</h3>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Action:</strong> Complex</li>
	<li><strong>Duration:</strong> Sustained</li>
	<li><strong>Infection-Mod:</strong> 8</li>
</ul>
<p>You craft an illusion and inflict it upon the target. The illusion
can range from a simple single-sense impression to a completely
immersive false reality and can override actual sensory input. The
illusion cannot directly harm the target, but it can provoke reactions
that are dangerous or even fatal (i.e., tricking someone into walking
off a roof ). Because the illusion is unsubstantial, it also may not stop
or start movement, hold weight, provide protection, etc. If the target
carefully examines the illusion or physically interacts with it, they
receive an INT Check to see through it. Likewise, if the illusion in any
way defies reality or inspires common-sense incredulity, or the real
world interferes with the illusion (sudden loud noises, walls hidden
by the illusion impede movement, etc.), the target gets an INT Check
to disbelieve. Targets that succeed in their INT Check will still faintly
experience the illusory input, but recognize it as unreal. No check
is needed if the target has proof the illusion is false. Complex or
lengthy illusions are hard to sustain; the GM may call for INT Checks
or appropriate skill tests to maintain the constructed facade.</p>
<p>Illusions require intense mental power to sustain. You may not
take any complex actions while sustaining this sleight, else the</p>

<h3>Implant Memory</h3>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Action:</strong> Complex</li>
	<li><strong>Duration:</strong> Instant</li>
	<li><strong>Infection-Mod:</strong> 6</li>
</ul>
<p>You implant a memory of up to an hour’s length inside the
target’s mind. This memory may be completely fabricated, based
on your real memories, or a combination of the two. Implanting
real memories is useful for archiving important data with an
ally, providing a literal alternate perspective, or simply making a
memory dump for the target to peruse. Fake memories are often
fuzzy and lacking detail, but bolstering them with real memories
makes them more convincing. At the GM’s discretion, a fake
memory that contradicts the target’s other memories, is drastically
out of character, or includes details that inspire skepticism may be
identified as false with an INT Check. Particularly traumatic memories
may inflict mental stress on the recipient when they are first
experienced. Implanted memories do not overwrite real memories.</p>

<h3>Implant Skill</h3>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Action:</strong> Complex</li>
	<li><strong>Duration:</strong> Hours</li>
	<li><strong>Infection-Mod:</strong> 6</li>
</ul>
<p>You impart your expertise and implant it into the target’s mind.
The target acquires your chosen existing skill at half value for
WIL ÷ 5 hours. If the target already has the skill, they use whichever
value is higher. Specialization bonuses also apply. Psi skill may only
be implanted if the target has the Psi trait. Recipients of skills will
exercise them with the async’s flair and mannerisms.</p>

<h3>Induce Error</h3>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Action:</strong> Complex</li>
	<li><strong>Duration:</strong> Minutes</li>
	<li><strong>Infection-Mod:</strong> 6</li>
</ul>
<p>You create a glitch in the target’s mind that causes them to
unconsciously do something wrong. The target automatically fails
a random skill test (chosen by the GM) made in the next WIL ÷ 5
minutes. With a superior success, you may choose which skill will
fail the next time it is used (if that skill is not used within the duration,
the sleight has no effect) or make the failure a superior failure.
This usually manifests as the type of common mistake that even a seasoned professional might make. For example, in combat the
target could forget to reload a weapon or alert an ally of a flanking
foe. Out of combat, the target might save the wrong file, forget
where they left something, mistake someone for someone else, or
leave a security door unlocked.</p>

<h3>Infectious Mind</h3>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Action:</strong> Complex</li>
	<li><strong>Duration:</strong> Sustained</li>
	<li><strong>Infection-Mod:</strong> 4</li>
</ul>
<p>You share a triggered disorder or active infection influence effect
with the target. At the GM’s discretion, prolonged exposure may
inflict stress damage to the target.</p>

<h3>Influence</h3>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Action:</strong> Complex</li>
	<li><strong>Duration:</strong> Action Turns</li>
	<li><strong>Infection-Mod:</strong> 4</li>
</ul>
<p>This is an offensive version of the Control Behavior sleight. You
manipulate the target’s cortices and emotions. Apply an Enhanced
Behavior or Restricted Behavior (Level 2) trait ▶80. You may push
this trait to Level 3.</p>

<h3>Invigorate</h3>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Action:</strong> Complex</li>
	<li><strong>Duration:</strong> Instant</li>
	<li><strong>Infection-Mod:</strong> 4</li>
</ul>
<p>You trigger a rush of neurochemical energy in the target. They
may expend their next complex action collecting themselves; this
counts as a short recharge action ▶35, without needing to expend
the full 10 minutes. Note that this sleight does not provide an extra
recharge, it simply shortens the time frame.</p>

<h3>Mimic</h3>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Action:</strong> Quick</li>
	<li><strong>Duration:</strong> Instant</li>
	<li><strong>Infection-Mod:</strong> 4</li>
</ul>
<p>You telepathically ping the target, collecting an intuitive snapshot
of their personality quirks and mannerisms. You may use this
imprint of the target’s mind to your advantage when mimicking
their behavior and social cues. Apply a +10 modifier to Deceive
Tests to impersonate the target, +10 per superior success.</p>

<h3>Mindlink</h3>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Action:</strong> Quick</li>
	<li><strong>Duration:</strong> Sustained</li>
	<li><strong>Infection-Mod:</strong> 2</li>
</ul>
<p>You establish two-way mental communication with the target.
If mindlinked with more than one target simultaneously, you may
act as a telepathic server so that everyone mindlinked with you
can also telepathically communicate with each other (though you
will overhear everything). Language is still a factor in mindlinked
communications, but this barrier may be overcome by transmitting
sounds, images, emotions, and other sensations.</p>

<h3>Neural Hardening</h3>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Action:</strong> Complex</li>
	<li><strong>Duration:</strong> Minutes</li>
	<li><strong>Infection-Mod:</strong> 4</li>
</ul>
<p>You harden the target’s sensory input pathways and mechanisms.
For WIL ÷ 5 minutes, they receive +10 to resist basilisk hacks, +10
per superior success.</p>

<h3>Nightmare</h3>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Action:</strong> Complex</li>
	<li><strong>Duration:</strong> Instant</li>
	<li><strong>Infection-Mod:</strong> 6</li>
</ul>
<p>You bombard the target with horrific images and sensations,
eroding their mental stability. You inflict 2d10 SV to the target,
+1d6 per superior success. This is reduced by mental armor.</p>

<h3>Pain</h3>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Action:</strong> Complex</li>
	<li><strong>Duration:</strong> Instant</li>
	<li><strong>Infection-Mod:</strong> 6</li>
</ul>
<p>You activate the target’s nerve endings and clusters, inflicting
a painful burning sensation. Treat as a pain effect ▶216; the target must take their next action to flee away from the async or area at
full movement.</p>

<h3>Psi Shield</h3>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Action:</strong> Complex</li>
	<li><strong>Duration:</strong> Sustained</li>
	<li><strong>Infection-Mod:</strong> 2</li>
</ul>
<p>You rally the mind’s defenses against psychic attacks. Increase
mental armor by 1d6, +1d6 per superior success.</p>

<h3>Psychic Stab</h3>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Action:</strong> Complex</li>
	<li><strong>Duration:</strong> Instant</li>
	<li><strong>Infection-Mod:</strong> 6</li>
</ul>
<p>You trigger dangerous neurochemical impulses and biofeedback
in the target’s brain and nervous system. You inflict 2d10 DV, +1d6
per superior success, reduced by mental armor.</p>

<h3>Sense Infection</h3>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Action:</strong> Complex</li>
	<li><strong>Duration:</strong> Instant</li>
	<li><strong>Infection-Mod:</strong> 2</li>
</ul>
<p>You detect whether the target is infected with a biological nanovirus
or nanoplague strain of the exsurgent virus — or if they are an
async. You know only whether or not the target is infected; superior
successes may provide gut feelings about the target’s specific
strain and its effects. GM note: under no circumstances should you
provide the name of the strain — focus on its nature.</p>

<h3>Short Circuit</h3>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Action:</strong> Complex</li>
	<li><strong>Duration:</strong> Instant</li>
	<li><strong>Infection-Mod:</strong> 6</li>
</ul>
<p>You force the target’s synapses to misfire. This functions like a
shock attack ▶219; the target loses neuromuscular control, falls
down, and is incapacitated for 1 action turn (+2 turns per superior
success) and stunned for 3 minutes.</p>

<h3>Spam</h3>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Action:</strong> Complex</li>
	<li><strong>Duration:</strong> Action Turns</li>
	<li><strong>Infection-Mod:</strong> 6</li>
</ul>
<p>You overload and flood the target’s sensory cortices, spamming
them with confusing and distracting sensory input. The target is
impaired, suffering –10 to all actions, plus an extra –10 per superior
success, for WIL ÷ 5 action turns.</p>

<h3>Static</h3>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Action:</strong> Complex</li>
	<li><strong>Duration:</strong> Sustained</li>
	<li><strong>Infection-Mod:</strong> 4</li>
</ul>
<p>You generate an anti-psi jamming field, impeding the use of
ranged sleights within Close range by –30. This sleight has no effect
on self or Touch-range sleights.</p>

<h3>Subliminal</h3>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Action:</strong> Complex</li>
	<li><strong>Duration:</strong> Hours</li>
	<li><strong>Infection-Mod:</strong> 10</li>
</ul>
<p>You implant a single post-hypnotic suggestion into the target’s
mind which they will carry out as if it was their own idea. Implanted
suggestions must be short and simple; the GM may require suggestions
be encompassed in a short sentence (for example: “open the
airlock” or “hand over the weapon”). Suggestions may include a
short trigger condition (“when the alarm goes off, ignore it”). The
target receives a WIL Check to resist any suggestion that is immediately
life threatening (“jump off the bridge”) or that violates their
motivations or personal strictures.</p>

<h3>Tranquility</h3>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Action:</strong> Complex</li>
	<li><strong>Duration:</strong> Minutes</li>
	<li><strong>Infection-Mod:</strong> 4</li>
</ul>
<p>You calm the target, relieving stress and anxiety. The target
is relieved of the effects of an acute stress response ▶223 or triggered
disorder for WIL ÷ 5 minutes. You may not use this sleight
on yourself.</p>
