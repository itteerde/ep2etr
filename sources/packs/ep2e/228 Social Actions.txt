<p>It’s important not to forget the social element in action scenes.</p>
<h2>Social Manipulation</h2>
<p>Just as Provoke skill can be used for social attacks ▶next column, the skills of Deceive, Kinesics, Persuade, and Provoke (Skills ▶48) can be used for myriad purposes, whether you are talking your way out of a tight spot, wringing information out of a suspect, or determining if someone is setting you up.</p>
<p>Almost all social skills are handled as opposed tests, as noted in the skill descriptions. There are several factors that might provide modifiers to these tests:</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p><strong>NPC Attitude:</strong> An NPC’s attitude towards a character should be rated on a scale from supportive to indifferent to hostile, each applying an appropriate modifier to social skill tests, as noted on the Social Modifiers table. Note that PCs can use Deceive, Persuade, or Provoke specifically to change these attitudes; a successful test raises or lowers the attitude one step, plus one per superior success. Failed social skill tests will worsen an NPC’s attitude by one step, plus one step per superior failure. Note that attitude has no effect on Kinesics Tests.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><strong>Request:</strong> The nature of the request and its repercussions to the NPC — or anyone they care about — should be taken into account. Antagonistic or hostile NPCs will not willingly help out; they can be manipulated towards a better attitude first or simply intimidated. Cooperative and supportive NPCs will fulfill simple/beneficial requests without needing a test.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><strong>Other Factors:</strong> Deceive Tests are impacted by believable stories, far-fetched circumstances, convincing proof, or unlikely circumstances. Persuade Tests are boosted by bribes and reciprocal exchanges or hindered by unfavorable timing. Use of Provoke skill to interrogate is aided by physical size and threats, while seduction is impacted by style and thoughtfulness. Kinesics Tests benefit from experience with the target or familiarity with their background through research. For all of these situations, also take the player’s specific words into account — a player who presents an eloquent argument for their PC’s Persuade Test, for example, should receive an appropriate modifier.</p>
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>Gathering Information</h3>
<p>In some circumstances, old fashioned legwork is the best method for digging up intel. If you use your social skills to canvass a neighborhood, chat up the locals, or carouse with the intent of picking up gossip, handle it as a task action with a timeframe set by the GM (usually 1d6 ÷ 2 hours). The skill used depends on the approach you take: use Deceive to pass yourself off as someone else, Persuade to carefully interview, Provoke to incite real talk, or even Kinesics to simply sit back, scan the crowd, and watch relationships and interactions. The GM applies modifiers appropriate to the situation and determines what information is available (if any). Moxie can be used to automatically acquire a clue without a test, but you must still put in the effort.</p>
<h3>Social Stigma and Status</h3>
<p>Though progressive cultural ideas continue to gain ground, transhumanity has not yet eradicated social inequalities and prejudices. It is an unfortunate fact that many social stigmas still exist — and these may have a direct impact on your social skill tests. Depending on who you are dealing with, your social status may provide positive or negative modifiers, ranging from +/–10 to +/–30. The most common prevalent stigmas (especially in the inner system) are towards the clanking masses, AGIs, uplifts, and pod morphs. Factions with polar opposite ideologies may also view each other critically: anarchists/scum vs. hyperelites, bioconservatives vs. heavily modified transhumans, brinkers vs. socialites. In an opposite vein, members of marginalized communities may favorably view allies or those of the same background, and almost anyone will take note of someone with a high rep score in their faction.</p>
<h3>Using Motivations</h3>
<p>Whether negotiating or picking fights, it is helpful to know what drives the person you are dealing with. With a lengthy conversation and a successful Persuade Test (opposed by SAV Check), you may be able to ascertain one of an NPC's motivations (GM discretion). If you are able to weaponize this knowledge against the NPC with an appeal or insult to their interests, the GM may apply a modifier to your social skill test. Similarly, you may unknowingly touch upon an NPC's motivations when dealing with them, thus acquiring a modifier depending on whether you support/encourage their interests or conflict with them.</p>
<h2>Social Attacks</h2>
<p>Provoke skill can be used in a number of offensive ways during action scenes. The following examples show what you can accomplish with a successful opposed test, pitting your Provoke skill against their WIL Check. As always, the GM arbitrates what modifiers apply and the final results of such provocations.</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p><strong>Calm:</strong> You temporarily soothe an opponent into pausing hostilities.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><strong>Fluster:</strong> You discombobulate or confuse an opponent; they suffer –10 to their next action. Increase this by an additional –10 per superior success.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><strong>Inspire:</strong> You rally an NPC on your side, motivating them towards victory; they receive +10 to their next action.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><strong>Intimidate:</strong> You scare an opponent into pausing their next attack, attacking someone else, taking cover, or running away.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><strong>Taunt:</strong> You rile up an opponent, forcing them to focus on you and attack you with their next action.</p>
    </li>
</ul>
